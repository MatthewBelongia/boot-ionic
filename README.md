ionic-boot
===========================

An example Ionic Application that uses a Spring Security protected REST backend. The backend is based on Josh Long's
[x-auth-security](https://github.com/joshlong/boot-examples/tree/master/x-auth-security) project. The frontend
is refactored to use [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com), an AngularJS-based framework for creating native mobile apps
with HTML5.
